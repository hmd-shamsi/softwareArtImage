**=INFLUENCE=**

- _**background**_ consists of an abundant number of stars that are continously moving. 
- _**shapes**_ present include decagons, octagons, quadrilaterals, triangles, and much more.
- _**colors**_ used are composed using calm shades of a gradient that subtely shifts from _alien_ green to _monster_ purple.
- _**concept**_ is inspired by the numerous assignemts and sketches we have been assigned ranging from the construction of simple shapes to the complex inclusion of noise rotation using time-dependant functions to implement animations.
- _**story:**_ a curious alien is shown to go through dimensions in a process where he gets controlled by influence as he gets curious about triangluar candies that are out of his reach _(includes a little plot twist)_.
- _**pictures**_ and a _**video**_ are previewed below!

- a _green_ alien, let's name him Bob, is shown to be in what seems to be a dark place full of stars, space!
- he looks somewhat confused with how he got here... the slightly opened jaw proves it.

- Bob notices you as you press the _spacebar_! (pun intended)
- his eye immediately turns to you, he does that occasioanlly, signalling confusion.
- _(10 sided - decagon dimension)_

- however, you are least of his concerns right now because he realizes that something is next to him.
- Bob instantly shifts his eye to the bottom right as he sees a _purple triangle_ which causes him to get intrigued!
- _(09 sided - nonagon dimension)_

- he gets even more interested when he spots another triangle under him... wait another one on his right... left... all around!
- _(08 sided - octagon dimension)_

- Bob tries to get to the triangluar pieces _(everytime you press space)_ as he looks at them constantly, but he is unable to.
- yet, something weird catches you offguard as you realize that Bob is not the way he looked like when you met him?!
- _(07 sided - heptagon dimension)_


**screenshot#6:**

- "they truly do grow fast" you sigh... however, you realize that Bob has been LOSING HIS SIDES!
- Bob has started of with 10 charming sides! Why is does he only have half the amount now?!
- _(06 sided - hexagon dimension)_


**screenshot#7:**

- you realize the more time he spends around these _purple triangles_, the more he is altered... "wait... wasn't Bob green?!" you suddenly exclaim.
- you see Bob's transformations right in front of your eyes, and you connect the dots...
- _(05 sided - pentagon dimension)_


**screenshot#8:**

- "shifting from green to purple... losing his sides from 10 to 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and now 4..." this causes you to inevitably realize the next incoming shape, this causes you and Bob lock eyes.
- this means that our beloved Bob will...
- _(04 sided - diamond dimension)_

- Bob has indeed become a _purple_ _triangle_... a candy.
- HE ALSO SPINS! (imitating the candies surrounding him)
- _(03 sided - candy dimension)_

**extras:**
- pressing the _'A'_ key reverts the damage/change done, so do not worry... no Bobs were harmed during the making of this.
- holding _space bar_ and then _'A'_ displays a cool effect as you see Bob go through his stages all over again!
